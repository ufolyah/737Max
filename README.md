# 737Max Timeline

### 03/06/2020 D. Xu
All of the source code should be put under B737Max/src.  
All of the pre-built library in jar should be put under lib/

package App for GUI (currently using JavaFX, we can change it if any of you prefers another one.).  
package Driver for CLI entry point (to make a custom test or prototype demo).  
package Test for future tests using JUnit (not included now).  
package Components for all kinds of internal functionality.

I updated object model for fixing CamelCase.  
I have create the class files in Components based on our object model.  
I implemented Flight class for your reference.  
The QueryFactory is copied from the sample, remaining incomplete.

To avoid conflicts and repeat work, before you start working on a file, tell us in this Readme.  
And tell us again once you finished. 

Do not delete anything in this timeline, just append it.

Also, if there is any mistake in the object model, like CamelCase, email me or update it yourself and inform others here.
